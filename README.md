# disease_detector
Code to detect diseases in plants from photos of their leaves

This project was inspired by https://machinelearningprojects.net/leaf-disease-detection-flask-app/
however I wrote the code from scratch without looking at Abishek's solution

The data set of leaf images came from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dev523/leaf-disease-detection-dataset

I figured out how to import the images and translate them into numpy arrays using the tutorial at https://realpython.com/storing-images-in-python/

To learn how to build a CNN I followed the tutorial at https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python#step-2 while watching the Stanford lecture series at https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk
